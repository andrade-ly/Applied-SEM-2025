DATA: FILE IS "sem_categorical.dat";
type is individual; 
! individual means that each row is one observation, each column is a variable

VARIABLE:
! Compare this input with the one in R, where we used colnames()
! Here, we're telling Mplus the names of our variables
NAMES ARE age sex white child init inhib cont bfi psyeffect sched insec prehabit
sl exer dt screen sm subs fri work hobby fam;

! Telling Mplus which variables this model will use
USEVARIABLES ARE init inhib cont bfi psyeffect

! Defining the missing data
Missing are .;

ANALYSIS:
! MLR is more robust than ML to deviations from normality
ESTIMATOR IS MLR;

MODEL:
